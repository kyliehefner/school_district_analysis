# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
### Purpose
A school district board has recently learned that some of the data used in their analysis of schools in the district was compromised. Said data was the 9th grade math and english test scores from Thomas High School. In order to maintain integrity of the report, the school board needs the school district analysis to be redone.
### Task
I was tasked with removing the affected part of the data (9th grade math and english test scores from Thomas High School), and repeating the analysis which included the following:
1. The district summary
2. The school summary
3. The top 5 performing schools
4. The bottom 5 performing schools
5. The average math scores by grade level for each school
6. The average reading scores by grade level for each school
7. The scores by spending per student
8. The scores by school size
9. The scores by school type

## Results
Removing the compromised data changed the analysis in the following ways:
